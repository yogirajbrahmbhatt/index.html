As said in my first intro, I'm a proud Indian student, trying to explore various aspects - especially INDIAN CULTURE, History, Spirituality, Philosophy, Politics, Technology, Arts etc. I always like to get introduced as Student,"विध्यार्थी" - who is tended to learn as much as he can, who seeks new opportunities & experiences, who explores many things and who practices the righteousness with a pious heart and mind...</p><p align="justify">Well, speaking more on me...I would term myself as a enthusiastic & intriguing student, as I'm always keen to learn all those things that soothes my mind. Although the thirst of gaining knowledge is never going to quench - but it surely gives a joy of learning. I'm also bit artistic - trying to get my hands on painting, writing, media works, music, voice over and all such stuff. I am too fortunate for being a Hindu, blessed with so many loved ones as my family - friends & most lucky for getting birth in the heavenly soil of INDIA. Being a follower of Great Indian, as well as Non-Indian Dignitaries, I am always trying to sculpt myself to act in the most legitimate way possible and also spread the message of the same to my fellow humans...</p><p align="justify">"Lastly, No one and Nothing in this world today, can describe all about anyone and anything... even this description too... so stay tuned, stay connected and we'll walk together on the path of Ultimate Happiness...

I was always into making new things, be it anything - a Science project, delivering a Speech, a Painting, an Artwork, a compilation of analysis on any topic, a Literature content, a piece of Media works, a computer program or a website and lots of other things. All these boost me more and more for learning and experiencing new aspects. And the lessons that I learnt, are really useful in both, professional & personal life. There are so many works of mine,I even consider my small sketch work also as one project and that too helps in nourishing myself. Hereby, I present my some of the works - many other works & achievements are forgotten or not meant to publicize now...</p><p align="justify"><li>Foremost of my all works is establishment of <b><i> "ADWITIYA BHARAT - Cluster of Industries"</i></b>. which is a all-in-one compilation of my works. Here, Photography - Videography, Media Works, Computer Technology, Site developing, Education etc. are included.</li></p><p align="justify"><li>Then I'll like to mention about my Oration skills (Public Speaking).<b>"A good Reader can be a best Speaker"</b> and I am privileged that in my tender age, my mother and grandpaa made me an avid reader. As a result, I get good content to speak and my journey as Orator started. I remember, my first big stage appearance was infront of 2000 people. I had participated and also had won various Elocution events like - "AKSH" organized by KSV, BAPS Bal Adhivesan etc. But very soon I realized that winning hearts of people is far better than winning a trophy, earning Claps and Appreciation is better than earning Certificates and<b> to speak for a CHANGE - "INQUILAAB", to speak for spreading Truth & Righteousness is far better than to speak for winning any Competition.</b> And therefore, I started speaking only for winning hearts and to ignite flame of Truth - Righteousness - Inquilaab</li></p><p align="justify"><li>And my Reading-Speaking and Social Interactive skills helped me in writing good content too. I've wrote Poems and Essays - Articles. initially I used to participate in such competitions too, but soon the realization changed my mindset for writing. The book of my poems, named <a href="https://notionpress.com/read/kavya-yog">"KAVYA YOG"</a> is published and available to buy.</li></p><p align="justify"><li>As mentioned earlier, I am little bit an Artist too - and hence, I keep sharpening my skills of Painting and other forms of Artwork</li></p><p align="justify"><li>Being a Computer Engineering student, I'd also acquired the basics of Python programming, Cyber Security, Data Science, Automation, Web Development, C language, Computer System basics, Cloud technology, Blockchain, Search Engine optimization, Digital Marketing etc. I'm more focused on Python and its inclusive technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science etc. This field is the most dynamic field and thus, I need to constantly learn and accept the upcoming updations. Therefore for me, one inclined in such technological field is a Student forever...</li></p><p align="justify"><li><b>"INDIANism" is my dream Campaign. Today we Indians have forgotten our glorious and valorous golden History, our Vedic Education and knowledge, our Ideal way of life, our humanitarian Morals-Values-Ethics, Our Cultural Heritages, preachings of BHARATIYA SANSKRITI; i.e Civilization and Lifestyle. Hence, I and some of my dearest friends have started making our efforts to spread awareness and Cultural preachings...We had formed a small group for that, named as <i>"HINDUSTAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMY"</i></b></li></p><p align="justify"><li>A Human is a dynamic creature and so do I and You... So lots of other works are yet to arrive in this listing...because <b>"The only constant thing in the world is CHANGE..."</b></li></p> </article> <article id="about"><h2 class="major">"CV / résumé"</h2><p><a href="cv.pdf">Click to view in PDF</a></p> <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="" /></span><p></p> </article> <article id="contact"><h2 class="major">Contact</h2><h3>You can e-mail me at <a href ="mailto: adwitiyabharat1@gmail.com"><i>adwitiyabharat1@gmail.com</i>...</a></h3><h3>Or You can <a href="#" class="icon brands fa-whatsapp"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a> me at <u>(+91)8511891515</u>...</h3> <br><h3>or fill the form below:</h3><form action="https://formspree.io/f/xvovbaae" method="POST"><p>Name <input type="text" name="name" required></p><p>Email <input type="text" name="email" required></p><p>Phone Number<input type="text" name="phone" placeholder="along with your Country code" required></p><p>Message<textarea name="message" rows="6" cols="25" required></textarea><br /></p> <input type="submit" value="Send"> <input type="reset" value="Clear"></form> <br><h3>Or you can reach to me through this Social Media Handles. . .</h3><ul class="icons"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/yours_yogiraj" class="icon brands fa-twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8R2Xn-28T8lHGpUcR9Ngbg" class="icon brands fa-youtube"><span class="label">YouTube</span></a></li><li><a href="#" class="icon brands fa-facebook-f"><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></li><li><a href="#" class="icon brands fa-instagram"><span class="label">Instagram</span></a></li><li><a href="#" class="icon brands fa-linkedin"><span class="label">Linkedin</span></a></li></ul> </article></div> <footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">&copy; 2020 All rights reserved by YOGIRAJ BRAHMBHATT</p></footer></div><div id="bg"></div> <script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="assets/js/browser.min.js"></script> <script src="assets/js/breakpoints.min.js"></script> <script src="assets/js/util.js"></script> <script src="assets/js/main.js"></script> <script>window.watsonAssistantChatOptions={integrationID:"810b9297-69bc-4bba-b4ec-2d57d5493f35",region:"us-east",serviceInstanceID:"7514a412-8836-49e7-924e-e67eef9c5622",onLoad:function(instance){instance.render();}};setTimeout(function(){const t=document.createElement('script');t.src="https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/loadWatsonAssistantChat.js";document.head.appendChild(t);});</script> </body></html>
